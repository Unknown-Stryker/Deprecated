# Frogman Engine Lab Legacy 2022 code
Thousands of code lines have been written since the start of the Frogman Engine development. This folder is the tomb of the legacy Frogman Engine code. Many of these are not included as the part of the current Frogman Engine repository.  
The goal of the project is to study and understand the concepts and the basics of computer science in games.  
Building everything from scratch, including STL is not an easy road to take, and it is a time-consuming task.  
I had to face with a choice whether to leverage third party libraries moderately or to create all from empty disregarding time schedule.  
However, implementing the game engine was prior to coding from scratch.
